            A brief meditation on contrast, accompanied by photographs from a winter afternoon.

          <p>
            Winter light has a quality that other seasons lack. It arrives at an angle, slanting
            through windows, stretching shadows to impossible lengths. Everything becomes a study
            in contrast.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've been drawn to this lately—the way light defines space, the way shadow gives
            depth to the ordinary. A coffee cup becomes sculptural. A bookshelf becomes a
            composition.

              Light is the first of painters. There is no object so foul that intense light
              will not make it beautiful.

            Emerson wrote that. He was onto something. The same room can feel sterile under
            fluorescent light and magical in the golden hour. The objects don't change—only
            our perception of them.

            Perhaps that's the lesson. Not to seek out extraordinary subjects, but to wait
            for extraordinary light. To be patient. To notice.

          <p>
            The shadow is just as important as the light. Without darkness, there is no depth.
            Without contrast, no drama. The interplay between them is where the interest lives.

            A short post today. Sometimes images speak better than words.
