            There's something to be said for craftsmanship in an age of disposability. When we build
            with intention, when we choose materials—physical or digital—that age gracefully, we're
            making a statement about what we value.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've been thinking about this as I built this blog. The choice to use plain HTML and CSS,
            no build step, no framework. It's not the modern way. But there's something appealing
            about a website that will work in twenty years, in any browser, with no dependencies
            to break or security patches to apply.
          </p>

            When I look at old furniture—a walnut desk from the 1940s, a leather chair worn soft
            by decades of use—I see objects that have outlasted trends, outlasted their makers,
            outlasted whole eras of design philosophy. They persist because they were built with
            care, from materials that develop character rather than decay.
          </p>

          <h2>Digital Patina</h2>

          <p>
            Can digital things have patina? I think they can, in their own way. A personal website
            that's been updated over years, accumulating posts and memories. A piece of software
            that's been refined through thousands of small improvements. A codebase that shows
            the marks of many hands, many decisions, many lessons learned.
          </p>

          <p>
            The opposite of patina is churn—the constant rewriting, the framework du jour, the
            assumption that whatever exists must be replaced. Sometimes replacement is necessary.
            Often it's just fashion.
          </p>

          <h2>What Lasts</h2>

          <p>
            Text lasts. HTML lasts. Simple things last. Complexity decays.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm not arguing for technological stasis. New tools solve real problems. But there's
            wisdom in asking, before adopting something new: will this still work in five years?
            In ten? Will anyone understand it? Will I?
          </p>

          <p>
            The web has a wonderful property: backward compatibility. A webpage from 1995 still
            renders. The same cannot be said for most software ecosystems. Perhaps there's
            something to learn from that.
          </p>

          <h2>Building Slow</h2>

          <p>
            I've started approaching projects differently. Instead of reaching for the most
            powerful tool, I reach for the simplest one that will do the job. Instead of
            optimizing for development speed, I optimize for comprehensibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            This isn't always possible. Some problems genuinely require complex solutions.
            But many don't. Many problems have been solved before, simply, and those solutions
            still work.
          </p>

          <p>
            There's a pleasure in building things that feel solid. Things with weight. Things
            you could hand to someone and say: here, this is yours now—it will serve you well.
          </p>

          <p>
            That's what I'm aiming for, anyway. One page at a time.
